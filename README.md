# Ideabox

## Abstract:
Sometimes you just need to jot your ideas down somewhere - good and bad alike. The Ideabox is a simple web application designed to archive, categorize, and filter through those ideas for the user so that they can come back, find, and pare them down to their favorites later.

## Installation Instructions:
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- In your forked GitHub repository, click the `code` drop-down menu and copy the SSH key.

### Option 1
- Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to.
- On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier.
- A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.
- On the command line, run “open index.html”.

### Option 2
- In the forked repository you created, open the “Settings” tab and select “Pages”  on the left pane.
- Under “Build and Deployment”, select “Deploy from a Branch” within the “Source” drop-down menu.
- Under “Branch”, select the “main” branch in the drop-down menu and hit the “Save” button.
- On the right-hand side of the main page of your repository, find the “Environments” section and click the link for “github-pages” - this may take some time to load at first.
- In the following page, hit the “View Deployment” button to view the site.

## Context:
The contributor team completed this project as part of their module one coursework for the [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The contributors entered the program in January 2023 and are expected to graduate in August 2023.
This project was completed over the course of five days in line with the Project Specification and Rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/ideabox-group-v2.html).
The intent of the project is to build and demonstrate developer collaboration skills, functional and well-organized HTML and CSS, and Javascript adhering to DRY (don’t repeat yourself) and SRP (single responsibility principle) conventions.

## Learning Goals:
The primary goals of this project were to integrate our understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript code, as well as to strengthen and refine our co-working skills within the group. The secondary goal was to create a fully-functional application that met all of the project requirements in terms of design and usability. To meet these goals, we worked not only with the three aforementioned code languages, but also with VS Code reader and GitHub, project management tools such as Trello and Google Docs, and researched new functionalities via websites like Mozilla Developer Network and Stack Overflow. 

## Wins + Challenges:
One of our issues was working with flexbox, and utilizing those efficiently. GitHub workflow is also still a challenge, although it’s getting easier with practice. The largest issue is evenly dividing workflow without getting too far ahead to actually test implementation code– we all find it difficult to understand how this process would work in an actual professional setting. 

Overall we had a lot of wins– we feel our code is very readable, organized, and straightforward. That’s something we all would like to carry forward into future projects. We were able to capture some really complex functionality into efficient, pity code. On a teamwork note, we also felt that our communication was clear and professional. John was a great project manager and did a fantastic job of teaching the rest of the group how to better utilize productivity tools to stay on track.
